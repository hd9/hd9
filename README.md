# Bruno Hildenbrand
_Sr Software Engineer, tech lead, solutions architect, and open source enthusiast._

## üëã Hi there! Thanks for visiting this page 
I'm a long-time software engineer who love sharing tips about development, cloud, [Linux](https://www.linux4us.com), [Vim](https://www.vim4us.com),   
best practices, security, design patterns and software architecture primarily in .NET and [Go](https://www.golang4us.com).

Check my blog at: [blog.hildenco.com](https://blog.hildenco.com)

## About Me
### üî≠ I currently work...

### ‚ö° My main interests are...
Open source software in general, including (but not limited to) Linux, VIM, Bash, Fedora, Go, Azure, Docker,    
Kubernetes, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, software development, software architecture, cloud, databases, etc...

### üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on...
Outside of my day job, I usually build cloud apps using Go, GraphQL, Docker, Kubernetes and PostgreSQL/sqlite    
just for fun(c) üòâ and post them here and [on my blog](https://blog.hildenco.com).

# Open Source
I love open source software! That passion started 20 yrs ago when I tried [Slackware Linux](http://www.slackware.com/).   
Today I'm a long-time [Fedora](https://blog.hildenco.com/2018/11/thank-you-fedora.html),
[Vim](https://www.vim4us.com) and [i3](https://blog.hildenco.com/2019/08/how-i-fell-in-love-with-i3.html) user.
