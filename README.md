# Bruno Hildenbrand
_Sr Software Engineer, tech lead, solutions architect, and open source enthusiast._

### Hi there! Thanks for visiting this page üëã
I'm a long-time software engineer living in Canada. I love sharing tips about development, cloud,   
best practices, security, design patterns and software architecture using primarily .NET and Go.

Check my blog at: [blog.hildenco.com](https://blog.hildenco.com)

## About Me
### üî≠ I currently work...
Developing cloud apps using .NET/.NET Core, Go, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes and lots of different databases.   
Oh! And sometimes I also do some front-end development using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org).

### ‚ö° My main interests are...
Open source software in general, including (but not limited to) Linux, VIM, Bash, Fedora, Go, Azure, Docker,    
Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, software development, software architecture, cloud, databases, etc...

### üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on...
Outside of my day job, I usually build cloud apps using Go, Docker, Kubernetes and PostgreSQL/sqlite    
just for fun(c) üòâ and post them here and [on my blog](https://blog.hildenco.com).

### üå± I‚Äôm exploring...
I'm currently exploring:
* **Go stuff**: Nats, Revel, Echo, Buffalo, Nats, ...
* **Mobile apps**: React Native and Flutter
* **Cloud stuff**: Firebase, GCP, Azure & Cloud CMSs
* **Architectural stuff**: design patterns and anything related to cloud architecture
* **Headless CMSs/PIMs**: Contentful, Contentstack, Dotcms & Censhare
* and lots of other random stuff..

# Open Source
I love open source software! That passion started 20 yrs ago when I tried   
[Slackware Linux](http://www.slackware.com/). Today I'm a long-time [Fedora](https://blog.hildenco.com/2018/11/thank-you-fedora.html),
Vim and [i3](https://blog.hildenco.com/2019/08/how-i-fell-in-love-with-i3.html) user.
